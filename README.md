# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects**

Welcome to my **EDA Projects** repository! In this collection, I showcase various datasets and the **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) process I‚Äôve followed to derive meaningful insights from them. Each dataset is analyzed using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, **Bokeh**, and other data visualization tools.

## üìå **Why This Repository is Important**
This repository is a hands-on demonstration of the **power of data analysis**. It serves as a portfolio of my work where I explore different datasets to extract valuable insights that can help inform decisions in real-world applications. Each project emphasizes key skills in:

- **Data cleaning** and preprocessing
- **Data visualization** and interpretation
- **Pattern discovery** and feature analysis
- **Statistical analysis** and hypothesis testing

The main goal is to create clear visualizations and meaningful conclusions from raw datasets that can serve as a foundation for machine learning or business decision-making.

## üìä **Projects and Datasets Included**
This repository contains multiple datasets, each analyzed in its own project folder:

### üç∑ **Wine Quality EDA**
- **Dataset**: Wine quality dataset with physicochemical features of red and white wine.
- **Focus**: Analyzed how acidity, alcohol content, and other factors affect wine quality.
- **Visuals**: Box plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrix visualizations.

### üå∏ **Iris Dataset EDA**
- **Dataset**: Iris flower dataset.
- **Focus**: Explored the correlation between petal and sepal features to predict flower species.
- **Visuals**: Scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots.

### üö¢ **Titanic EDA**
- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset with passenger details.
- **Focus**: Analyzed survival rates based on features such as age, gender, and class.
- **Visuals**: Bar plots, survival rates visualization, and heatmaps.

And more datasets will be added as the project evolves.

## üõ† **Technologies and Libraries Used**
- **Python** for programming
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for static data visualizations
- **Plotly** & **Bokeh** for interactive visualizations
- **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook** for executing and presenting the analysis

## üß† **What I‚Äôve Learned**
Throughout this project, I have gained the following insights:

- **Data cleaning**: Handling missing data, outliers, and ensuring datasets are ready for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Creating compelling and clear visual representations (scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, interactive visualizations) to convey insights effectively.
- **Statistical analysis**: Understanding distributions, correlations, and relationships between features.
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying trends and relationships that might be useful for predictive modeling.

## üìÅ **Repo Structure**
The repo is organized by individual datasets, with each folder containing the following:

- **EDA-Notebook**: A Jupyter notebook or Google Colab notebook with the detailed analysis.
- **Dataset**: The original dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.) used in the analysis.
- **Visuals**: Key charts and visualizations from the EDA (e.g., images of plots).
